# random-api
The source code of the random API website I wrote

<b>Run on local machine</b>

If you want to view it in localhost make sure you download all the python modules from `requirment.txt`, and all the node modules from `packge.json`.

I recommend crating a `.flaskenv` file.

Make sure that the database file is working properly.

After, run `npm run build` in the terminal and when you start your flask app (`flask run`) it all should work as intended.
